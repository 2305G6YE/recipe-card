<h1>Recipe Cards</h1>

<h3>Overview<small>(16th April 2025)</small></h3>
<p>After completing the first exercise in TOP (The Odin Project) on Flexbox, I decided to practice the alignment options I have learnt. This is a new html that comprises the recipes I written in an earlier repository (odin-recipes), but in a summarized form. The aim is to first space it out evenly, then convert it into a responsive website that stacks the recipe cards ontop of each other. This is especially important once the webpage width shrinks (like in a mobile version).</p>

<h3>Motivations and Goals</h3>
<p>I think based on the previous repository I did (flexbox-1) reconstructing a flexbox homepage from the "Interneting is hard" website, I learnt the importance of sourcing good color palettes and cute fonts. This makes the website look less clunky and out of the early 2000s. I would be aiming to achieve a slightly more modern look, but at the same time keeping in mind the aim is primarily for flexbox alignment practice. </p>
